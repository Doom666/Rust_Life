# Rust Life Project
I am interested on intelligence, life simulations and psycology/ Behaviour.
I chose to ditch Python and learn Rust due to rust being more strict, fast and in depth than python.
I am reading the Rust book, but I burn for implementing something, typing, seeing something in the screen.

## Learning Rust by doing
Let's see how far I get with this one....

## About this project

I want to create some "alive agents" into an envioronment, to create a life simulation.

in a 2D plane, there will be vegetation, represented by a growing cellular automata branching structure.
then there will be creatures that eats this vegetation, they will move smoothly.

the creatures will move by a reinforcement learning algorythm, so its behaviour will be emergent more than hard coded.

### Challenge 1: Bevy and Rurel

I'll try to implement rurel example and create a window with a moving blue circle, representing a creature and a green scuare shape, representing a plant:

- [ ] Rurel example run
- [ ] Bevy window - black BG 666x666 px
- [ ] bevy circle - randomly spawn
- [ ] bevy scuare - randomly spawn
- [ ] bevy blue movement Bithug666!
